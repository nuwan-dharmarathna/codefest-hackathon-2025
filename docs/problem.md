# Problem Statement â€“ GoviChain

## ðŸŽ¯ Context & Pain Point

Across rural Sri Lanka, thousands of women-led micro-enterprises are growing or producing local goods â€” agricultural produce, handmade crafts, packaged foods, and more. These entrepreneurs often sell their products within their village or at local fairs, relying heavily on physical presence or middlemen to reach customers.

But here's the problem:

> ðŸ”¥ These entrepreneurs **lack a reliable, digital way to manage orders, coordinate deliveries, and securely receive payments** from distant buyers.

They donâ€™t have access to enterprise-level e-commerce tools, logistics tracking systems, or digital marketplaces that support their small-scale, hyper-local business needs. As a result:
- ðŸ“‰ They lose potential income due to limited reach
- â›” Buyers hesitate to trust unknown sellers without verified identities
- ðŸ’¸ Payments are risky, delayed, or require in-person collection
- ðŸšš Deliveries are done informally, often without clear tracking or cost transparency

This limits growth, reduces trust, and widens the digital divide â€” especially for **women in rural areas**.

## ðŸ“Š Evidence

- A 2021 World Bank report noted that **only 23% of women-led SMEs in Sri Lanka use digital tools** for operations or sales.
- Anecdotal feedback from local cooperatives suggests **lack of delivery coordination** and **payment security** as two main blockers for growth.
- Informal interviews with rural producers reveal that many have lost orders or faced fraud due to **no structured system** for order management or payments.

## ðŸ”’ Scope

GoviChain targets **micro-scale women-led businesses** who:
- Operate in rural or semi-urban locations
- Sell perishable or non-perishable products
- Do not have access to complex logistics or payment systems

We do **not** attempt to solve full-scale delivery logistics or build a large e-commerce platform. Instead, we focus on:
- Enabling **verified seller-buyer communication**
- Providing **order tracking**
- Ensuring **secure payments** via escrow
- Showing **pickup location** on map or basic delivery preference

By solving this small but critical gap, GoviChain aims to bring trust, visibility, and structure into micro supply chains â€” one order at a time.
