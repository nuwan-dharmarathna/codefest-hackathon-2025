## üîê DPI Integrations

| DPI Component | Purpose | Integration |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
| **SLUDI** | User authentication | Sellers & buyers login using SLUDI sandbox (OAuth 2.0 / OIDC) |
| **NDX** | Logistics & marketplace data | Backend fetches sample postal rates, SME registry, and maps delivery cost estimates |
| **PayDPI** | Payment system | Escrow-style payments: buyer pays upfront, seller receives payment after delivery confirmation |

## ü§ñ AI Middleman Detection Agent

To maintain fairness and transparency in the marketplace, GoviChain includes an **AI-powered middleman detection system**.

### **How It Works:**
1. **Periodic Review:** The agent reviews each seller account at scheduled intervals.
2. **Data Collection:** Fetches:
   - Tenders posted
   - Accepted bids
   - Advertisements
   - Completed orders
3. **Behavior Analysis:** Uses rule-based and pattern recognition logic to check if the seller‚Äôs activity indicates:
   - Direct production (authentic seller)
   - Reselling without production (possible middleman behavior)
4. **Scoring:** Assigns a **Middleman Score** with reasoning.
5. **Admin Action:** High scores flag sellers for manual review by platform administrators.

### **Benefits:**
- Protects genuine producers from unfair competition.
- Improves buyer trust by ensuring product source transparency.
- Allows for early intervention before middleman abuse impacts the platform.

## ‚ú® Bonus Feature: Buyer Request System (Reverse Marketplace)

In addition to browsing seller listings, GoviChain allows buyers to post custom **product requests** (e.g., ‚ÄúNeed 100kg onions‚Äù) and receive price offers from available sellers.

### üíº Why This Matters:
- Encourages **competitive pricing**
- Surfaces **hidden seller inventory**
- Helps buyers source bulk orders from trusted micro-entrepreneurs
- Encourages **transparent, data-driven commerce**

### üîÑ Extended Flow:
#### Buyer:
1. Submit a new request (product + quantity + notes)
2. View incoming price offers
3. Accept one offer to initiate an order (auto-created)
4. Pay via PayDPI ‚Üí receive product ‚Üí confirm

#### Seller:
1. View open buyer requests
2. Submit price offers with optional notes (delivery available, etc.)
3. Get notified if selected
4. Fulfill the order as usual

### üß† API Endpoints for Buyer Request Flow:
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/requests` | POST | Buyer creates a product request |
| `/api/requests` | GET | Seller views buyer requests |
| `/api/requests/:id/offer` | POST | Seller submits price offer |
| `/api/offers/:id` | GET | Buyer views all offers |
| `/api/offers/:id/status` | PATCH | Buyer accepts an offer |

This system allows other buyers to **browse past offers** and **contact new sellers**, growing the network of trusted sellers in the ecosystem.

- Buyer request system could support ratings, filters, and NLP in the future
- AI agent can be enhanced with machine learning models over time
